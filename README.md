The analysis presented in this code reviews school performance metrics against a variety of factors, including school size, whether it's a charter school, and the budget attributed per school and per student.

The data indicates that there is a strong correlation between school size and overall passing rates - 58% in a large school vs. 90% for medium and small schools. There is also a correlation between charter and district schools, where 90% of students overall pass from a charter school, but the overall passing rate for a district school is only 54%. A correlation does not seem to exist between budget per capita and passing rates - some of the smallest pending per student ranges exhibited the highest overall passing rates. Additional analysis is needed to determine charter schools are the only schools with lower spending rates per student or if both district and charter schools make up this subset of schools. If only charter schools show low spending per student, this indicates expenditure on student through perhaps some other metric not measured within this data.
